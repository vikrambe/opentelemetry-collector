# Prometheus Receiver

Receives metric data in [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) format. See the
[Design](DESIGN.md) for additional information on this receiver.

Supported pipeline types: metrics

## Getting Started

This receiver is a drop-in replacement for getting Prometheus to scrape your
services. It supports the full set of Prometheus configuration, including
service discovery. Just like you would write in a YAML configuration file
before starting Prometheus, such as with:

```shell
prometheus --config.file=prom.yaml
```

You can copy and paste that same configuration under:

```yaml
receivers:
  prometheus:
    config:
```

For example:

```yaml
receivers:
    prometheus:
      config:
        scrape_configs:
          - job_name: 'otel-collector'
            scrape_interval: 5s
            static_configs:
              - targets: ['0.0.0.0:8888']
          - job_name: k8s
            kubernetes_sd_configs:
            - role: pod
            relabel_configs:
            - source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_pod_annotation_prometheus_io_scrape]
              regex: "true"
              action: keep
            metric_relabel_configs:
            - source_labels: [__name__]
              regex: "(request_duration_seconds.*|response_duration_seconds.*)"
              action: keep
```
